Abstract

A synthesis of perfluorinated rubrene is reported. Electrochemical analysis revealed the significantly increased electron affinity of perfluororubrene compared with non-modified rubrene. Crystallographic investigation revealed two polymorphs and a solvate, each displaying twisted backbone conformations of perfluororubrene. Taken together, these results suggest perfluororubrene will find applications as a new n-type semiconductor.
