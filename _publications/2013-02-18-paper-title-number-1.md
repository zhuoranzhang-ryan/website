Abstract

An effective method was developed to prepare triphenyleno[1,2,3,4-ghi]perylenediimide derivatives, via ICl-induced annulation, dehalogenation, followed by photocyclization. A perylenediimide (PDI) dimer featuring a terphenyl bisethynylene linker was thereby transformed into a benzo[k]tetraphene fused with two benzoperylenediimides. These PDI derivatives exhibited electron mobility up to 0.079 cm23 V−1 s−1 in solution-processed thin film transistors.
